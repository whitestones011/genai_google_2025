# 5-day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google 2025

This is compilation of Kaggle Gen AI Intesive Course with Google 2025.

I'm using it as my personal notes.

## Prerequisite

Sign up for an [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat) account and generate an [API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## [Day 1 - Prompting](./prompting/)

In this section:

Exploting the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. The art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction and evaluating LLMs. 

The first codelab is about getting started with the Gemini 2.0 API and covers several prompt techniques including how different parameters impact the prompts. In the second codelab, you will also learn how to evaluate the response of LLMs using autoraters and structured output.
