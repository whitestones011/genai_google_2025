# Prompt configuration

```python
from google.genai import types

config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    max_output_tokens=100,
    temperature=2.0,
    top_p=.95,
)

response = client.models.generate_content(
      model='gemini-2.0-flash',
      config=config,
      contents='Write an essay about yourself'
)
```

## max_output_tokens

The output length affects cost and performance. Specifying `max_output_tokens` parameter does not influence the generation of the output tokens, so the output will not become more stylistically or textually succinct, but it will stop generating tokens once the specified length is reached.

## temperature

The `temperature` parameter controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Higher temperatures result in a higher number of candidate tokens from which the next output token is selected, and can produce more diverse results, while lower temperatures have the opposite effect, such that a temperature of 0 results in greedy decoding, selecting the most probable token at each step.

Temperature doesn't provide any guarantees of randomness, but it can be used to "nudge" the output somewhat.

## top_p

Top-P parameter is also used to control the diversity of the model's output.

Top-P defines the probability threshold that, once cumulatively exceeded, tokens stop being selected as candidates. A top-P of 0 is typically equivalent to greedy decoding, and a top-P of 1 typically selects every token in the model's vocabulary.

You may also see top-K referenced in LLM literature. Top-K is not configurable in the Gemini 2.0 series of models, but can be changed in older models. Top-K is a positive integer that defines the number of most probable tokens from which to select the output token. A top-K of 1 selects a single token, performing greedy decoding.

## stop_sequences

With the ReAct prompting to capture a single step at a time, while ignoring any hallucinated Observation steps, you will use `stop_sequences` to end the generation process. 

# Prompt types

## Zero-shot

Zero-shot prompts are prompts that describe the request for the model directly.

```python
zero_shot_prompt = """Classify hotel reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.
Review: The hotel location is central but the facilities are dates.
Sentiment: """
```

##Â One-shot and few-shot

Providing an example of the expected response is known as a "one-shot" prompt. When you provide multiple examples, it is a "few-shot" prompt.

`````python
few_shot_prompt = """Parse a customer's pizza order into valid JSON:

EXAMPLE:
I want a small pizza with cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni.
JSON Response:
```
{
"size": "small",
"type": "normal",
"ingredients": ["cheese", "tomato sauce", "pepperoni"]
}
```

EXAMPLE:
Can I get a large pizza with tomato sauce, basil and mozzarella
JSON Response:
```
{
"size": "large",
"type": "normal",
"ingredients": ["tomato sauce", "basil", "mozzarella"]
}
```

ORDER:
"""
`````

## Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique where you instruct the model to output intermediate reasoning steps, and it typically gets better results, especially when combined with few-shot examples. It is worth noting that this technique doesn't completely eliminate hallucinations, and that it tends to cost more to run, due to the increased token count.

By asking to "think step by step" help to solve hallucinations.

```python
prompt = """When I was 4 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now,
I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step by step."""
```

## ReAct: Reason and act

Check out the [Searching Wikipedia with ReAct](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Search_Wikipedia_using_ReAct.ipynb) cookbook example.

```python
model_instructions = """
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation,
Observation is understanding relevant information from an Action's output and Action can be one of three types:
 (1) <search>entity</search>, which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it
     will return some similar entities to search and you can try to search the information from those topics.
 (2) <lookup>keyword</lookup>, which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current context. This only does exact matches,
     so keep your searches short.
 (3) <finish>answer</finish>, which returns the answer and finishes the task.
"""

example1 = """Question
Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?

Thought 1
The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.

Action 1
<search>Milhouse</search>

Observation 1
Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.

Thought 2
The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".

Action 2
<lookup>named after</lookup>

Observation 2
Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.

Thought 3
Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.

Action 3
<finish>Richard Nixon</finish>
"""
